I decided not to follow through with the sidebar for the desktop view as shown in the 3rd wireframe, which depicts the Materials/To Do/Completed page. Rather, I retained the stacked navigation bars shown in the mobile wireframes.

### What I Learned:
My partner and I decided to work on the project separately. From this assignment, I learned how important it is to plan out the website first. As I was thinking of the layout and how information should be organized on the page, I have come across issues that have now been avoided since I was able to think ahead. Furthermore, it serves as a great blueprint that I can follow as I build the actual website.
