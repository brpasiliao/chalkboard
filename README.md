I decided not to follow through with the sidebar for the desktop view as shown in the 3rd wireframe, which depicts the Materials/To Do/Completed page. Rather, I retained the stacked navigation bars shown in the mobile wireframes. I also have not had the opportunity to implement a grid view, which would be beneficial for bigger screens.
